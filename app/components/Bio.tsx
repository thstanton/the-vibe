                From the parades of Brazil and New Orleans to the loud, proud
                celebration music of the balkans and Mexico, brass instruments
                are the sound of the worldâ€™s parties getting started!

                Ideal for creating a jubilant atmosphere at outdoor
                celebrations, our four piece band is able to roam amongst
                guests, lead parades, or simply provide a great backdrop of
                uptempo fun with celebratory music from across the globe - plus
                some familiar singalong contemporary pop in the mix for good
                measure.

                The Vibe bring the sizzle to your summer festival or street
                party, and jolt an Oktoberfest event to life with interactive
                oompah drinking songs. We can bring the unmistakable fizz of
                live music to your drinks reception, or a warm glow to your
                Christmas market with a set of seasonal classics. Sound the
                trumpets, bring The Vibe and kick off the fun!
