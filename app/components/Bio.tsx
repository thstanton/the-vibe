                From the parades of Brazil and New Orleans to the loud, proud
                celebration music of the Balkans and Mexico, brass instruments
                are the sound of the world&apos;s parties getting started!

            <p className="pb-4 font-sans">
                Four-piece brass band The Vibe bring nothing but good mood music
                and the sizzling atmosphere of a spontaneous street party.
                Igniting jubilant singalongs wherever they roam, expect
                everything from New Orleans-tinged pop to throwback club
                classics - the musicians bring their collective experience from
                thousands of events, celebrations and festivals and mix it all
                together in a colourful carnival. It&apos;s a blast of good
                vibes!
            </p>
            <p className="pb-4 font-sans">
                The band is able to move around amongst guests, lead parades, or
                simply lift the mood with a fun, upbeat and perfectly crafted
                musical backdrop to accompany any event. Alternatively, they can
                provide a memorable, high-energy stage show (with PA hire
                option) to get a crowd on their feet!
